# accent-comparison
A comparison of Dubin, Liverpool and London Accents using Mann Whitney U statistical testing method.

You can run the "full_code.ipynb" in Juypter Notebook. All dependencies are included in the requirements.txt.

Please ensure you have the appropiate directory structure in place, just follow the same path structure that is in the commited config json structure that is visible in the ipynb file. 

If you are not running this in Juypter, all the code is provided in .py files. You will still need to install the dependencies and setup up the required directory structure and then you can execute each file independently. The perform_mann_whitney_and_permutation_test is created as part of the pitch script and this will need to be imported into the other feature scripts prior to execution since its a shared function.
